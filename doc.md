# Project Documentation: Pree-App Analysis (Detailed)

**Version:** 1.0 (Draft)
**Date:** [Insert Date]

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Project Overview
This document provides a detailed analysis and documentation for the "Pree-App" project. Based on the available file structure (`android/`, `ios/` folders, Flutter build artifacts) and commit history ("improved the ui", "added new weight screen page", "flutter upgrade"), the project appears to be a mobile application developed using the Flutter framework.

### 1.2. Goals and Objectives
While the specific high-level goals are not explicitly defined in a central configuration file (like `pubspec.yaml`), commit messages suggest the application aims to provide features related to user health or activity tracking, potentially including:
*   Weight monitoring ("added new weight screen page").
*   Daily behavior or symptom logging ("added dairy to record daily behaviour").
*   A central dashboard or overview ("updated dashboard ui", "added overview page").

The project likely aims to deliver a cross-platform experience for both Android and iOS users.

### 1.3. Target Audience
*[ACTION NEEDED: Define the target audience for this application. E.g., General users, pregnant women, specific patient groups?]*

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1. Development Framework & Languages
*   **Frontend:** Flutter SDK (indicated by build artifacts, `android`/`ios` structure, and commit messages). Language: Dart.
    *   *Note:* The core Flutter configuration file (`pubspec.yaml`) is missing from the root directory, preventing analysis of specific frontend dependencies and metadata. A Flutter framework upgrade was performed recently (commit `26f51de`).
*   **Backend:** Firebase Functions (Node.js runtime). Language: JavaScript (Node.js).
    *   Indicated by `firebase.json` configuring a "functions" source directory.
    *   `functions/package.json` specifies Node.js v20 engine.
*   **Version Control:** Git, hosted on GitHub (`github.com/256-katendechris-256/pree-app` inferred from merge commit `79c9d52`).

### 2.2. Architecture
*   **Frontend-Backend Communication:** Likely uses HTTPS requests from the Flutter app to Firebase Cloud Functions endpoints.
*   **Backend Services:**
    *   Firebase Authentication (Implied, standard for Firebase-backed apps).
    *   Firestore Database (Likely for storing user data like weight, diary entries - standard Firebase setup).
    *   Firebase Cloud Functions (`firebase-admin`, `firebase-functions` dependencies): For custom backend logic.
    *   **OpenAI Integration:** The inclusion of the `openai` package (`^4.93.0`) in `functions/package.json` strongly suggests integration with OpenAI's API for features possibly involving AI-driven insights, summaries, or interactions based on user input (e.g., diary entries).
*   **Platform Support:** Android and iOS (standard Flutter capability).

### 2.3. Development Workflow
*   **Branching Strategy:** Utilizes feature branches (`Katende`, `Kyomuhangi`, `martin`) alongside `main` and `master`. Developers work on features in separate branches before merging.
    *   `origin/Katende`: Focused on UI features like Overview page, Daily Diary, Dashboard UI.
    *   `origin/martin`: Focused on backend setup and Flutter upgrade.
    *   `origin/main`, `origin/Kyomuhangi`: Reflect merges and dependency updates (e.g., `pubspec.yaml` update commit `c3acd05`, although the file is now missing).
*   **Collaboration:** Multiple contributors (`fatum123akh`, `Katende Chris Marvin`, `Martin`) are involved. Merges are used to integrate work (e.g., commit `79c9d52`).

## 3. Results & Current Status

### 3.1. Implemented Features (based on commit logs)
*   **User Interface:**
    *   General UI improvements (commit `796954b`).
    *   Dashboard UI development and updates (commits `9d652a2`, `309f4ee`).
    *   Weight tracking screen (commit `2c1e006`).
    *   Daily diary feature (commit `ab5dbe0`).
    *   Overview page (commit `a64b4f8`).
*   **Backend:**
    *   Initial backend setup using Firebase Functions (commit `003e572`).
    *   Potential integration with OpenAI API (based on `functions/package.json`).
*   **Platform:**
    *   Android and iOS build configurations are present.
    *   Flutter framework upgraded (commit `26f51de`).

### 3.2. Codebase Structure Highlights
*   `android/`, `ios/`: Standard Flutter platform-specific folders.
*   `functions/`: Contains Firebase Cloud Functions backend code (`index.js`, `package.json`).
*   `build/`: Contains build artifacts for Flutter/Android.
*   `PMD/trial_three.ino`: Presence of an Arduino file suggests a potential, perhaps experimental or deprecated, hardware interaction component. Its relevance to the main app needs clarification.
*   `firebase.json`: Configures Firebase project deployment, specifically pointing to the `functions` directory.

### 3.3. Current State
*   The application has several core UI features developed, primarily on the `Katende` branch.
*   Backend foundation using Firebase Functions is established on the `martin` branch, including a potential OpenAI integration.
*   Development work is currently fragmented across different branches (`Katende`, `martin`, `main`/`master`).
*   **Key Issue:** The `pubspec.yaml` file, essential for managing the Flutter frontend, is missing from the expected location, hindering build processes and dependency management.

## 4. Recommendations and Way Forward

### 4.1. Immediate Actions
1.  **Locate/Restore `pubspec.yaml`:** This is critical. Search the entire project history (`git log --all --full-history -- **/pubspec.yaml`) or local backups to find the last known version of `pubspec.yaml`. If unrecoverable, it may need to be recreated based on inferred dependencies and project structure. **This is the highest priority.**
2.  **Branch Consolidation:**
    *   Perform a `git fetch --all` to get the latest state of all remote branches.
    *   Carefully review the changes on `origin/Katende` and `origin/martin`.
    *   Merge these feature branches into the primary development branch (`main` or `master` - clarify which is definitive). Address any merge conflicts systematically. Example merge steps (assuming `main` is the target):
        ```bash
        git checkout main
        git pull origin main
        git merge origin/Katende # Review changes, resolve conflicts, commit
        git merge origin/martin # Review changes, resolve conflicts, commit
        git push origin main
        ```
3.  **Establish Main Branch:** Decide whether `main` or `master` is the definitive primary branch and remove/deprecate the other to avoid confusion. Sync remote HEAD if necessary (`origin/HEAD -> origin/main`).

### 4.2. Development Next Steps
1.  **Dependency Check:** Once `pubspec.yaml` is restored, run `flutter pub get` to ensure all frontend dependencies are correctly installed. Update dependencies if necessary.
2.  **Backend Integration & Testing:** Fully connect the frontend UI elements (Weight screen, Diary, Overview) to the Firebase backend (Firestore for data storage, Functions for logic/OpenAI calls). Test data saving and retrieval thoroughly.
3.  **OpenAI Feature Development:** Define and implement the specific feature(s) utilizing the OpenAI API. Ensure proper API key management and error handling.
4.  **Testing:** Implement a robust testing strategy:
    *   **Flutter:** Unit tests for Dart logic, Widget tests for UI components.
    *   **Firebase Functions:** Unit tests for function logic.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Test the full flow from UI interaction -> Firebase Function call -> Database update/OpenAI call -> UI update.
5.  **Code Review & Refactoring:** Conduct code reviews, especially after merging branches. Refactor where needed to improve clarity, performance, and maintainability. Address the potential `.ino` file's role â€“ integrate or remove if obsolete.
6.  **User Authentication:** Implement or finalize a secure user login/registration flow if not already complete.

### 4.3. Documentation & Deployment
1.  **Update README:** Create or update a `README.md` file in the root directory with:
    *   Project description and purpose.
    *   Setup instructions (Flutter SDK version, Firebase setup, environment variables).
    *   How to run the app.
    *   Backend deployment steps (`firebase deploy --only functions`).
2.  **Configuration Management:** Document required environment variables (e.g., Firebase config details, OpenAI API key) and how to manage them securely.
3.  **Deployment Plan:** Outline the steps for building release versions (`flutter build apk`, `flutter build ios`) and deploying to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

*[ACTION NEEDED: Review this detailed report. Fill in the specific target audience and confirm/clarify assumptions made, especially regarding the `.ino` file and OpenAI feature specifics. The most critical step is addressing the missing `pubspec.yaml`.]*
